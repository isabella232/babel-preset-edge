  // - "universal": Targetting both NodeJS and Browsers (Ideally suited for libraries published for both NodeJS and browsers via NPM)
  // - "auto": Define target automatically based on NODE_ENV environment.

  // Choose which transpilation should be applied.
  // One of the following:
  // - "es5": Standard output for widest engine and browser support. Ideally suited for publishing to NPM.
  // - "es2015": Alternative to standard es5 reaching only modern engines and browsers which support at least all features of es2015. Might be a good alternative for publishing modern libraries to NPM or when using transpilation on all content - even `node_modules` in application code.
  // - "modern": Uses a built-in definition of modern NodeJS and browser versions. This is interesting for local development of application as it accelerates features like hot-loading quite a bit.
  // - "current": NodeJS only. Ideally for local running test suites, etc. Using the least amount of transpile for making code runnable locally.
  // - "node": NodeJS only. Uses `engines` field in `package.json` to define the NodeJS version to target.
  // - "browser": Browser only. Uses local "browserslist" config to determine transpilation target. Uses `BROWSERSLIST_ENV` if configured. Otherwise uses `env` passed through preset or via `NODE_ENV`.
  // - "auto": Uses "browser" for `target: browser`. Uses "node" for `target: node`. Uses `es5` for `target: universal`.
  // - {}: A custom object which is passed to `@babel/preset-env`

  // - "auto": Automatically using the `EDGE_ENV` or `NODE_ENV` environment variables.
